#H1 My Portfolio

#H2 About the Project

For this portfolio project, I decided to focus on my photography and video projects, because I did'nt have a proper portfolio for these. Oftentimes, future employers will ask you to share your work with them when applying for a job, so I thought it would be a great opportunity.


#H2 The Process

I first started with a low fidelity (and later, a high fidelity) wireframe using Adobe XD. I wanted to plan exactly how it would look like because I knew I would be using the Bootstrap library.

With that in mind, I started experimenting with different colours and fonts that would suit my design. 

Because I knew that images and videos would be the main focus, I chose a dark background to contrast with that, so it would be easier to see.

All of the images used in my portfolio were taken by me.

#H2 Challenges

One of the challenges I had to face during the process of designing my portfolio, was being able to use the Bootstrap Classes properly. 

I had to change some of the code because I saw that there was already a Bootstrap class that could do the same with less coding on my end.


#H2 Conclusion

I really enjoyed the process of designing my portfolio using html, css and Bootstrap. I feel like I learn a useful skill I can use in other projects.

I also really appreciate the fact that I learned how to make my website resposive and accesible for everyone, which I think is one of the most important things for a media designer.
